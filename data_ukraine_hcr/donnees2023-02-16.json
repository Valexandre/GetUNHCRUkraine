{"situation_view_id":["54"],"situation_view_name":["Ukraine Refugee Situation"],"situation_view_description":["The escalation of the international armed conflict in Ukraine has caused civilian casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure, forcing people to flee their homes seeking safety, protection and assistance. Millions of refugees from Ukraine have crossed borders into neighbouring countries, and many more have been forced to move inside the country. They are in need of protection and support. In light of the emergency and the scale of humanitarian needs, an inter-agency regional refugee response is being carried out, in support of the efforts of refugee-hosting countries. The Regional Refugee Response Plan brings together UN, NGO and other relevant partners and focuses on supporting host country governments to ensure safe access to territory for refugees and third-country nationals fleeing from Ukraine, in line with international standards. It also prioritizes the provision of critical protection services and humanitarian assistance."],"data":[{"geomaster_name":"Poland","geomaster_id":10781,"admin_level":"Country","centroid_lon":"19.4013","centroid_lat":"52.1224","lat_max":55.4695,"lon_max":26.4013,"lat_min":48.0215,"lon_min":12.4013,"source":"UNHCR,
