{"situation_view_id":[54],"situation_view_name":["Ukraine Refugee Situation"],"situation_view_description":["The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has caused massive civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, forcing people to flee their homes seeking safety, protection and assistance. Since February 2022, millions of refugees from Ukraine have crossed borders into neighbouring countries, and millions more have been forced to flee within the country. They are in need of protection and support. In light of the emergency and the scale of humanitarian needs, an inter-agency regional refugee response is being carried out, in support of the efforts of refugee-hosting countries. The Regional Refugee Response Plan brings together national authorities, UN agencies, NGOs, as well as civil society organisations and focuses on supporting host country governments to ensure the inclusion of refugees, with full access to their rights, in line with international standards. It also prioritizes the provision of critical protection services and humanitarian assistance."],"data":[{"geomaster_name":"Poland","geomaster_id":10781,"admin_level":"Country","centroid_lon":19.4013,"centroid_lat":52.1224,"lat_max":55.4695,"lon_max":26.4013,"lat_min":48.0215,"lon_min":12.4013,"source":"UNHCR,
